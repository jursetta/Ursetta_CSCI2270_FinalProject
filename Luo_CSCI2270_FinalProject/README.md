# Luo_CSCI2270_FinalProject

 My project is an externsion for the binary tree.The project have ability to insert file when you want, and print the binary tree in level order like follow:
    
     a    
     
    /  \   
      b    c     
  
      /  \
      
    d    e
   
    to
    a
    b c
    d e
when you use print in the level order. More onver it can prints in the postorder. So the user will print in different order. And ir also can find the min depth and max depth. For more detail, we can add left rotate and right rotate or mirror function to this project, which will easier for people know what has change. I used the data from my father when he trade the wool and you can use it to to insert a file(a file call "Finalwool purchase" to put into the file)
